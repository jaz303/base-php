h1. BasePHP

h2. Overview

BasePHP is a small, general PHP class library. It's written to take advantage of the new features offered by PHP 5.3 which, given my current work-rate, will probably be in wide-use by the time this library is complete.

Main features:

* Object oriented database access with support for:
** lazy connection via instance registry
** smart(er) automatic value quoting
** exception wrapping for catching constraint violations
** automatic conversion/instantiation of boolean/date types
** table creation
** migrations
* Date & time classes
* Powerful "rewire" feature which automatically creates wrapper objects for file uploads and submitted date/currency values
* Currency class
* ISO country/language data
* MIME type handling
* <del>Image class supporting chainable operations, resizing, cropping and filtering</del> (maybe coming back soon)

BasePHP is designed to use class autoloading - if you don't like this, this library isn't for you.

h2. Installation

Very simple, just copy the contents of the "inc" directory into your include root. You'll probably want to add a couple of lines to your master include file to make your life easier - just check out 'configure.php' for details.

BasePHP currently includes no files intended for deployment to the webroot (stylesheets, scripts, images etc.). This may change in a future version if I start adding support for JavaScript libraries. Don't hold your breath, however.

h2. Running Tests

You can run the tests directly from the shell. For example:

  jason@ratchet ~ $ cd $BASE_PHP_ROOT
  jason@ratchet base $ php run_tests.php
